# Master's Project: Using graph neural networks to predict molecular properties

The thesis will summarize and build upon my experiences from the kaggle-competition ['Predicting Molecular Properties'](https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling) and the [Tencent Alchemy Contest](https://alchemy.tencent.com/).
In both competitions the data was 3D-structures of small organic molecules and the goal was to predict properties of these molecules.
