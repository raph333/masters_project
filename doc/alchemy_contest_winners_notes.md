# notes on winning architectures

## first place

* heavy manual feature creation - but does it have an impact?

## second place

* SchNet with edge updates

## third place 

DimeNet: directional message passing
good implementation on github

idea:
* rotate and translate molecules and measure the variance of precictions of different architectures
