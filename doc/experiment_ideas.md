## experiment ideas


### data
* compare manually constructed features from Tencent with raw data

### new architectures
* adapt DimeNet pytorch implementation

### modifications of Tencent MPNN
* graph state  
  check: mpnn_root.ipynb
* Tencent MPNN with edge updates
* set2set vs simple note summation

### other
* rotate and translate molecules and measure the variance of predictions of different architectures
