\subsection{Data and features}

The new quantum chemistry dataset \textit{Alchemy}, created by Tencent Quantum Lab, was used for this thesis~\cite{Chen2019}. The dataset is similar to the well established QM9 dataset with the same quantum mechanical properties available and a similar number of molecules. The main advantage of the new \textit{Alchemy} dataset is that it also contains larger molecules of up to 14 heavy atoms (i.e. non-hydrogen atoms) as opposed to the maximum of nine heavy atoms in the Q9 dataset.

There 119487 molecules in the dataset containing the 3D coordinates for each atom, its type and the information which atoms are covalently bonded and with which bond type and twelve important quantum mechanical properties~\cite{Chen2019}. The task is to predict these twelve properties from the raw data.

There are two different approaches to go about this task. The pure deep learning approach is to use only coordinates and bonds and rely on the network to learn to extract any features required to predict the target properties. After all, coordinates, atom types and bonds contain all the available information (actually the bonds could be reliably calculated from coordinates and atom types and thus, strictly speaking are redundant information).

The other approach is to calculate all sorts of chemical features using open source python libraries and feed them in to the model alongside the raw data. Such features are node (atom) features (whether the atom is an electron donor or acceptor, whether it is an an aromatic ring, it's hybridization type, etc.) as well as bond (edge) features. The fact that these features are calculated from the raw data without any additional information means that the model should also be able to learn to compute them if required. Hence, calculating features and feeding them into the model should in theory be obsolete but could give a slight performance boost if the model would not be able to learn those features. Since the focus of this thesis is deep-learning, no manual feature computation is performed here except if it is required to allow comparison with results from the literature.
