\subsection{Data and features}

The new quantum chemistry dataset \textit{Alchemy}, created by Tencent Quantum Lab, was used for this thesis~\cite{Chen2019}. The dataset is similar to the well established QM9 dataset with the same quantum mechanical properties available and a similar number of molecules. The main advantage of the new \textit{Alchemy} dataset is that it also contains larger molecules of up to 14 heavy atoms (i.e. non-hydrogen atoms) as opposed to the maximum of nine heavy atoms in the Q9 dataset. This property makes it more relevant for medically oriented research as potential drugs are not limited to only very small molecules.

There 119487 molecules [CHECK: old vs. new dataset] in the dataset containing the 3D coordinates for each atom, its type and the information which atoms are covalently bonded with which bond type and twelve important quantum mechanical properties~\cite{Chen2019} of the molecule. The task is to predict these twelve properties from the raw data.

There are two different approaches to go about this task. The pure deep learning approach is to use only coordinates and bonds and rely on the network to learn to extract any features required to predict the target properties. After all, coordinates, atom types and bonds contain all the available information (actually the bonds could be reliably calculated from coordinates and atom types and thus, strictly speaking are also redundant information).

The other approach is to calculate all sorts of chemical features using chemistry python libraries and feed them in to the model alongside the raw data. Such features are node (atom) features (whether the atom is an electron donor or acceptor, whether it is an an aromatic ring, it's hybridization type, etc.) as well as bond (edge) features. The fact that these features are calculated from the raw data without any additional information means that the model should also be able to learn to compute them if required. Hence, calculating features and feeding them into the model should in theory be obsolete but could slightly improve predictions if the model is unable to learn those features. Since the focus of this thesis is deep-learning, no manual feature computation is performed here except if it is required to allow comparison with results from the literature.

\subsection{Base network architecture}


\subsection{Software}

The models presented in this theses were implemented using the python deep learning library \textit{PyTorch}~\footnote{\url{https://pytorch.org/}} and its extension for graph neural networks, \textit{PyTorch Geometric}~\footnote{\url{https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}}.

The code is available at github: \url{https://github.com/raph333/masters_project}



\subsection{Training}
\label{sec:training}

In all experiments presented in this thesis, Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)[CITATION] was used for training. For certain experiments, other optimizers might lead to slightly better results. However, comparison between differences in data processing and network architectures would be impeded by employing different optimization schemes because one would never know if the different outcomes are a result of the model or the optimization. For this reason, optimization strategies were kept as constant as possible for all experiments.

The same considerations were applied to learning rates and learning rate scheduling. Two different optimization schemes were used for different purposes.
To obtain the lowest possible test-set error, a learning rate schedule that reduces the learning rate after the validation error plateaus has found to be most effective~\footnote{Specifically, the following parameters were chosen: The initial learning rate of 0.01 is reduced by a factor of 0.75 if the validation error did not decrease by a value of $10^{-4}$ or more within the last 10 epochs. The training duration was 300 epochs} This optimization scheme above suffers from the drawback of requiring many training epochs. Furthermore, the resulting learning-rate schedule varies considerably even between trainings with the same parameters. These differences as well as the long training time make it unsuitable for comparing learning curves with different parameters.
For comparing different learning curves a simpler, exponential learning-rate decay was chosen~\footnote{REFERENCE} [CITATON]. The advantage of this method is that at each epoch, all curves have the same learning rate making them comparable. The final validation error is usually higher than would be achieved with reduce-on-plateau learning rate scheduling. However, this drawback is accepted because the main point of the experiments is to compare different model architectures, parameters or data-transformation rather than to achieve the lowest possible test-set error.


\subsection{Benchmark and evaluation}

The target variable in this dataset is a real-valued vector of length twelve. The error-metric used throughout this work is the mean absolute error (MAE) - which was also the metric in the Alchemy Contest. As the twelve quantum mechanical properties have vastly different ranges, they have to be normalized - otherwise the properties with larger ranges would contribute far more to the MAE than the properties with smaller ranges. Normalization was performed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

\subsubsection{Difference between competition-dataset and full-dataset}

\paragraph{Overview} This subsection explains why the MAE-values presented in this thesis cannot be compared the competition leader-board~\footnote{\url{https://alchemy.tencent.com/\#leaderboard}} including my own score with rank 26. If the reader is only interested in the methods used for the thesis, this subsection may be skipped.

Unfortunately, the results obtained on the competition dataset cannot be directly compared to results achieved on the full dataset published after the competition. Figure~\ref{fig:competition-vs-full-ds} shows the learning curves of models being trained on both the competition-dataset and the full dataset. The MAE values are considerably lower on the competition dataset.


\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Comparing the full (post-competition) and the competition dataset using various methods for splitting the data into training- and validation-set. Both data-sets are evaluated using a random split (70\% training, 15\% validation, 15\% testing) and the train-validation split as it was defined in the competition (bias towards higher weight molecules in the validation set). In addition, the competition data is also subjected to a random split where the fraction of the validation-set is exactly the same as in the competition-data-split. (This last experiment was conducted to make certain the observed difference is due to the method of splitting and not due to the size of the validation set.)}
	\label{fig:competition-vs-full-ds}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Train-test split}
The competition data-set is split into training-set (called dev-set by the competition hosts), validation- and test-set with the ground truth being provided only for the first two sets. The split is not random. Instead, the validation- and test-set contain larger molecules than the training-set. Building models that can extrapolate from smaller molecules to larger molecules is useful for pharmacological research~\cite{Chen2019}. However, in order to focus on the core topic of GCNN for molecules, for most experiments presented in this thesis. I only use a simple random split where training-, validation- and test-set are randomly drawn without replacement from the same population.

Figure~\ref{fig:competition-vs-full-ds} shows learning curves for both competition-data split and random split to eliminate any differences in validation MAE hailing from the different dataset splits.
The figure shows two counterintuitive results. First of all, the MAE on is higher on the full dataset despite it's larger size. Naturally the larger dataset should better (or at least equally good) results. Secondly, the impact of the splitting method varies between the two dataset. The expected result would have been a lower MAE on randomly split data because the training- and validation- molecules come from the same distribution. Having a strong bias towards higher weight molecules in the validation set is expected to increase the MAE. For the full dataset, this is indeed the case. However, for the competition dataset, the random split gives a higher MAE than the biased competition split. As this result contradict our expectation, it was heavily tested and validated.

%First of all, it is obvious that the validation MAE is lower on the randomly split data. This comes as no surprise because in the competition-data split, the validation molecules are systematically different (larger) from the training molecules. However, regardless of the kind of data-split, the MAE-values are still consistently lower on the competition data.


\paragraph{Target variable normalization}

In the competition data-set, the values are already normalized and the raw values are not available. It is not clear whether the mean and standard deviation used for normalization where calculated separately for the training- and validation-set or if the they are based on all molecules. Furthermore, the order of the target variables is unknown (by design) as their names are hidden with dummy-names property-1, property-2, etc.

The full dataset released after the competition contains the raw values and the real names of the target variables. For training and evaluation, they were normalized in the same manner as in the competition (subtraction of mean and division by standard deviation). However, a direct comparison with the ranges of the competition dataset is not possible as the names of the target variables are not provided there. 

The only observation that can be made is that the average range (maximum - minimum) of all target variables is lower in the competition data-set. This suggest that the normalization might have been conducted on per-set basis because the range within a subset of the data is necessarily smaller or equal than the range of the full dataset. However, the small difference of an average range of 8.66 in the competition dataset and 9.72 in the full dataset is insufficient to explain the difference in MAE between the two datasets. Furthermore, such a difference could just as well be a function of dataset-size as larger datasets have a higher probability of containing more extreme outliers which increases the range of the target variables.

\paragraph{Molecule data}

The raw data and thus the input into the model is exactly the same in the full dataset as in the competition dataset. This has been thoroughly tested and verified.

\paragraph{Conclusion}

With the input-data as well as the data-splits being identical, the reason for the difference in MAE can only be explained by the different values of the target variables. As discussed above, the absence of raw data in the competition dataset prevents a direct comparison of the target variables between the two datasets. Thus, no further information can be obtained to pinpoint the difference of to find a possible explanation. The only conclusion to be made is that for some reason the target variables in the new data prevent the net from learning to predict them as well as in the competition data. For this reason, I chose to use the labeled competition data for the majority of experiments in this thesis. This comprises 103727 molecules from the training- and validation-set of the competition data.
Furthermore, I chose use the same training-validation split as in the competition because the MAE of the competition-data with this split could not be achieved by any other splitting method. While it is unfortunate not to know the root of this counterintuitive finding, it will have to remain a mystery in order to focus on the core topic of this thesis: graph neural networks. 

%However, unlike in the competition, I split these molecules randomly into 70\% training-, 15\% validation- and 15\% test-set.

 
\subsection{Experiments}

Most experiments show learning curves with validation- and training-error rather than just the final errors. The choice was made because, in addition to showing the final error-rates, learning curves allow to estimate whether the model suffers from high bias or high variance and also shows if prolonged training could lead to further improvements or if a plateau has been reached. In contrast, a single error-metric does not show how this metric was obtained and thus offers little information to interpret the results. Furthermore, learning curve averaging of multiple training runs was employed to reduce the impact of noise. Some variation in the learning curves is to be expected even in the absence of any difference in model architecture, input data or optimization strategy. Conduction multiple training runs for each setting and averaging the results reduces the impact of random variation and allow to see the systematic differences instead.
