In this master's project, I had the pleasure of investigating the exciting field of graph neural networks (MPNNs) for chemical applications. Two different machine learning competitions~\footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling}}~\footnote{\url{https://alchemy.tencent.com}} provided an excellent starting point for thinking about suitable data representations and models to solve a given problem. Furthermore, they allowed to benchmark the results against word-class machine learning practitioners and investigate their fascinating solutions after the competitions.

Graph neural networks are one of the most interesting frontiers of deep learning for a number of reasons. As stated in the Introduction (Section~\ref{sec:motivation}), most of the breakthroughs in deep learning occurred using image-data or natural language data (both, text and speech). Graph neural networks are one of the most promising methods for extending this success for other kinds of data. Another fascinating aspect of graph neural networks is that their applications encompass a lot of completely different fields: from social networks, to documents and molecular structures. For this reason, the model architectures are also required to be very diverse to fit the different use-cases.

In this particular project, the challenge of applying MPNNs to 3D molecular structures was investigated.
